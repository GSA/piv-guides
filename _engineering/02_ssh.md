For network engineers, this guide will help you authenticate with your PIV/CAC credential and use SSH to access a remote Linux server from a Windows or macOS computer. For server administrators, this guide will help you configure a Linux server for remote access.

This guide uses open-source options: 
* **Windows:** PuTTY-CAC (without Pageant) and WinSCP with Pageant
* **macOS:**  OpenSC 

Commercial solutions are also available.

### SSH Using PuTTY-CAC

PuTTY-CAC is an open-source SSH client that uses Microsoft's CryptoAPI (CAPI). (Pageant isn't needed with PuTTY-CAC for this solution.)
1. You'll need to download [**PuTTY-CAC**](https://www.github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases){:target="_blank"} to _C:\ssh\putty.exe_ or a similar folder. Select either _32-bit_ or _64-bit_, based on your Windows OS. (Pageant and MSI Installers aren't needed.)
2. Double-click on _putty.exe_ and insert your PIV/CAC card into your card reader.
3. At the **PuTTY Configuration** window, go to _Category:_ &gt; _Connection_ &gt; _SSH_ &gt; _Certificate_. Click the _Set CAPI Cert..._ button and _OK_.
<br><br>
![PuTTY Configuration Window]({{site.baseurl}}/img/ssh-putty-cac-1.png){:style="float:left"}
<br><br>
4. From the **Windows Security** list, select your PIV/CAC authentication certificate by clicking _OK_. If you don't see your certificate, click _More choices_. (For help with certificates, see [Understanding PIV Certificates](https://piv.idmanagement.gov/details/#understanding-piv-certificates){:target="_blank"}.)
<br><br>

<br>
5. Back at the **PuTTY Configuration** window, click the _Copy to Clipboard_ button and paste the SSH key into a text file. (**Note:** PuTTY-CAC derives the SSH key from the public key of your authentication certificate.) The SSH key will look like this:

   ```
      ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCyPn2dShOF...
      CAPI:05bf4653b3098a87b67816d81049f489d5b5ffb4
   ```    
6. Send the text file to the server administrator and request an account. (Notice that the _Attempt Certificate Authentication_ box is now checked.)<br>
7. While waiting for an account, you can create SSH session profiles for target remote servers:<br><br> 
     o Click _Session_ and enter a remote server's _hostname_ or _IP address_.<br> 
     o For _Connection type_, click _SSH_. (Notice that under _Port_, _22_ appears.)<br>
     o Enter a session name in _Saved Sessions_ and click _Save_.<br>
8. Once you have an account, open PuTTY-CAC and insert your PIV/CAC card into your card reader. 
9. Click a _Saved Session_ and _Load_. 
10. Click _Open_ to connect to the remote server. (A dialog box displays the server's key thumbprint.) 
11. Verify the server key and accept it by clicking _Yes_.
12. Enter your account username. (A dialog box displays your PIV/CAC authentication certificate.) 
13. Click _Yes_ to permit the _signing operation_ and enter your PIV/CAC PIN. (You'll then be logged into the remote server.) 

{% include alert-warning.html content = "The card reader may flash. Do not remove your card until you're logged in." %}

### SSH Using WinSCP and Pageant

WinSCP is an open-source, secure copy protocol (SCP) and secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) client. Pageant is an SSH authentication agent that uses Microsoft's CAPI.  

1. Download **Pageant** to _C:\ssh\pageant.exe_ or a similar folder. Select [_32-bit_](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/blob/master/binaries/x86/pageant.exe){:target="_blank"} or [_64-bit_](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/blob/master/binaries/x64/pageant.exe){:target="_blank"}, based on your Windows OS. 
2. Download the [**WinSCP installer**](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php){:target="_blank"} to _C:\ssh\WinSCP-Setup.exe_ or a similar folder.
3. Double-click _WinSCP-Setup.exe_ to launch the _WinSCP installer_ and use the recommended installation settings.
4. Double-click _pageant.exe_ to launch **Pageant**. 
5. Next, at the **Windows** taskbar, click the _up-arrow_ and right-click the **Pageant** icon (_computer wearing a Fedora_).

{% include alert-warning.html content = "The card reader may flash. Do not remove your card until you're logged in." %}

## SSH from macOS

{% include alert-warning.html content = "Network administrator privileges are needed to use SSH for remote access." %}

There are two options for configuring SSH clients to use a PIV/CAC device as the SSH key store:

### Built-in PIV/CAC support (macOS High Sierra and later)

1. Insert your PIV/CAC into your card reader.
2. Use ` ssh-keygen -D /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib` to get the OpenSSH-format public key fingerprint which can be added to your `authorized_keys` file, account profiles, etc.
3. Add `PKCS11Provider=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib` to your `~/.ssh/ssh_config` file to tell `ssh` to scan the PIV profiles for keys when determining which keys to attempt on remote hosts.

See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208372 for additional information

### OpenSC

You can use OpenSC on your macOS computer to authenticate to a remote server with your PIV/CAC card.  

1. Install [OpenSC](https://www.github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Download-latest-OpenSC-stable-release){:target="_blank"}. 
2. Insert your PIV/CAC into your card reader.
3. To view the certificates on your Mac, enter:  
     ```
	pkcs15-tool --list-public-keys  
     ```
4. Make note of the _PIV AUTH pubkey_&nbsp;&nbsp;**ID** number. 
     ```
	Using reader with a card: SCR35xx Smart Card Reader
	Public RSA Key [PIV AUTH pubkey]
		Object Flags   : [0x0]
		Usage          : [0xD1], encrypt, wrap, verify, verifyRecover
		Access Flags   : [0x2], extract
		ModLength      : 2048
		Key ref        : 154 (0x9A)
		Native         : yes
		ID             : 01 (EXAMPLE ONLY)
		DirectValue    : <absent>
     ```
5. Use your _PIV AUTH pubkey_&nbsp;&nbsp;**ID** number to view your SSH key. Enter: 
     ```
    pkcs15-tool --read-ssh-key 01
     ```
6. When prompted, enter your PIV/CAC PIN. The SSH key will look like this:  
     ```
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCyPn2dShOFLBnMraiP2MnLU ....  
     ```
7. Copy the SSH key and paste it into a text file.
8. Send the text file to the server administrator and request a new account.
9. Once you have an account, you can log into the remote server. Enter: 
     ```
	ssh -I /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so <username>@<remote-host>
     ```
10. Optionally, you can update the setting in the _/etc/ssh_config_ file to:  
     ```
	PKCS11Provider /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so
     ```
11. Enter your PIV/CAC PIN when prompted. Once it's validated, you'll be logged into the remote server.

## Configure a Linux Server

{% include alert-warning.html content = "Server administrators must have root privileges for these steps." %}
 
{% include alert-info.html content = "The following SSH configurations are examples only. Other options are available, including Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) that look up user accounts and authorizations through directories. You can automate account set-ups by using centralized configuration management tools that can push or remove authorized_keys." %}

By default, SSH keys are read from the _.ssh/authorized_keys_ file in your home directory. 

1. You'll need to create a _/home/&lt;username&gt;/.ssh_ directory and change it to the requester's ownership. Then, create an _authorized_keys_ file in the _.ssh_ directory and copy the requester's SSH key to the _/home/&lt;user&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys_ file starting with _ssh-rsa&lt;public key&gt;&lt;key_name&gt;_:
   ```
	    mkdir /home/<user>/.ssh
	    chown <user> .ssh
	    chgrp <user> .ssh
	    chmod 700 .ssh
	    cat > authorized_keys 
	    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQA... CAPI:05bf4653b3098a87b67816d81049f489d5b5ffb4    
   ```
2. Set the permissions for ..._authorized_keys_ to _600_ and change the _authorized_keys_ ownership to the user:
   ```
	     chmod 600 authorized_keys
	     chown <user> authorized_keys
	     chgrp <user> authorized_keys
   ```
3. You can change the location for the _authorized_keys_ file in the _/etc/ssh/sshd_config_ file and restart the _sshd_ service. You can also enforce authentication with a PIV/CAC card by disabling password use:
   ```
	     AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u  
	     PasswordAuthentication no
   ```
**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change the default settings, you'll need to create a corresponding directory for _authorized_keys_ under _/etc/ssh_ and place the _authorized_keys_ there vs. in the user's home folder.
