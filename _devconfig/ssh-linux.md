# How do I enable PIV for Secure Shell (SSH) to a UNIX-like system from a UNIX/Linux computer?

These procedures are intended for network and system administrators, or other IT professionals, who are responsible for the day-to-day network operations of Federal Government agencies. As part of their roles, these professionals will be authorized by their agencies to use secure methods to remotely access other computer hosts.

## Hardware Requirements

  * A Smart Card reader
  * A PIV card
  * A UNIX/Linux computer correctly configured to use a PIV card for login

## Procedures

### Configure SSH Daemon

  1. No SSH Daemon (SSHD) configuration is required. Place your **PIV card's SSH public key** in the appropriate authorized_keys file (e.g., /home/[login ID]/.ssh/authorized_keys).

  2. To optionally configure SSHD so that specific users may access a host via only their PIV cards, complete the following steps:

     1. Change the configuration in the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file. Then restart the **sshd**.

        ```
		AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/sshd/authorized_keys/%u
		PasswordAuthentication No
        ```

     2. Create the directory: **/etc/sshd/authorized_keys**.

        ```
		mkdir /etc/sshd/authorized_keys
        ```

     3. To allow one user to have such access, place the user&#39;s PIV card's SSH public key in the following directory, according to the user's name: **/etc/sshd/authorized_keys/[login ID]**. (**Note:** To ensure that access requirements are enforced, only a **root user** may modify this directory and its files.)  

     4. Disable any alternative means of access (i.e., via passwords), as needed.


### Log in via SSH

  1. Insert your **PIV card** into your computer's card reader.
  2. On **RHEL** and **CentOS**, run the following commands:
  
        ```
		eval $(ssh-agent)
		ssh-add –s libcoolkeypk11.so
        ```

  3. On other Linux distributions, run the following commands:

        ```
		eval $(ssh-agent)
		ssh-add –s opensc-pkcs11.so
        ```

  4. At the PIV card password prompt, enter your **PIN**. 
  
  > **Note:**  The card reader may flash. **Do not** remove the PIV card until the login process has been completed.

  5. Use the following command to list the **user&#39;s public SSH key**:
  
        ```
		ssh-add –L | egrep 'ssh-rsa'
        ```

 6. Add the user's public SSH key to the appropriate **authorized_keys file on the remote machine**.
 7. The user will now be able to log into the remote machine by using the following command:
 
        
		ssh <remote-host>
        

  > **Note:**  **Do not** remove the PIV card from the card reader until the login process has been completed. The key will no longer work after removing the PIV card. After replacing the PIV card, run the following command to restart the PIV card to enable the keys to once again be available to SSH. 
  

		ssh-add –e opensc-pkcs11.so
