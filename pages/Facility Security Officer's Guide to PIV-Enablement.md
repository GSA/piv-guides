###Facility Security Officer's Guide to PIV-Enablement

####Introduction
The purpose of this playbook is to provide you, a Facility Security Officer, an
 overview of how to bring your facility in compliance with Homeland Security 
 Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 has was published in August 2004.  
 Its intent was to establish a common set of policies for creating "secure and 
 reliable" forms of identification for government employees and contractors.  
 
 It will not be a substitute for becoming familiar with the publications we have 
 referenced here, but it should give you a general idea of what will be involved.

The first two sections of this playbook are based on [the most recent Risk 
Management Guideline from ISC](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ISC_Risk-Management-Process_Aug_2013.pdf).  
Note that nowhere in this publication is "PIV" mentioned.  That's because this 
document covers the entire realm of physical security, and PIV is only a part of 
the overall picture.  

The next sections discuss how PIV cards can enhance the physical security of 
the facility.

Finally, we discuss the procurement process.

####1. Create a Facility Security Committee

If your facility has no _Facility Security Committee_, _Appendix D: How to 
Conduct a Facility Security Committee_, explains the purpose, makeup, and 
function of the _Facility Security Committee_ (FSC). It discusses...

####2. Know your security requirements.  
  * Determine your facility's risk level.  
 
       _Section 4_ provides tables that help you "score" your facility in terms 
     of 5 equally-weighted security factors:  
 
         * Mission Criticality
         * Symbolism
         * Facility Population
         * Facility Size
         * Threat to Tenant Agencies

       Your score is a called the _Facility Security Level_ (or FSL).  The rationale 
       for the security factors are explained later in _Section 4_ if you are 
       unsure as to what the factors mean.

       You may need to consider intangible factors as to whether you should raise or 
       your FSL.  An example cited is the duration of occupancy. Or, if your
       facility is a one-of-a-kind, i.e., there are no other government facilites 
       that perform the function that yours does, then it may very well be deemed as a _Very High_ FSL due to its criticality factor.  _Section 4.5_ contains guidance for determining whether your site meets that level.  

  * Determine your facility's countermeasures.

       _Section 5_ provides guidance for creating: an application of baseline 
       _Level of Protection_ (LOP) for your site, B - Countermeasures_ from 
       [Office of the Interagency Security Committee](mailto:ISCAccess@DHS.gov\?subject=Request for Appendix B - Countermeasures).  
       Using this, complete the risk management process which is 
       depicted in the _Risk Management Process_ flowchart in _Figure 1_.  The 
       flowchart helps you to identify assets and risks and to adjust levels of 
       protection for your facility that meet those risks.

####3. Learn How PIV Card Usage can Improve Security
You are likely already using your PIV cards to sign on to your network.  This was
one of the early payoffs to the use of PIV cards.  You may also be using your PIV
cards to access your buildings as well as other areas within your buildings.  The
PIV card is capable of cooperating with an incremental security model, where 
higher-value assets can be protected with stronger levels of security, enforced
by your PACS and the PIV card itself. 

NIST Special Publication SP 800-116, [Recommendation for the Use of PIV 3 Credentials 
in Physical Access Control 4 Systems \(PACS\)](http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-116) 
provides a great source for explaining how you can leverage your PIV card and PACS to 
match the security requirements at your facilities.  To tie together the 
800-63-described "LITTLE or NO, SOME, HIGH, and VERY HIGH" e-Assurance _Levels 
of Assurance_ (LOA), 800-116 aims to do the following, quoted directly from the 
publication:

* _Discusses the different PIV Card capabilities so that the risk-based assessment 
can be aligned with the appropriate PIV authentication mechanism._
* _Uses the concept of "Controlled, Limited, Exclusion" areas to employ risk-based 
PIV authentication mechanisms for different areas within a facility._
* _Proposes a PIV Implementation Maturity Model (PIMM) to measure the progress of 
facility and agency implementations._
* _Recommends to federal agencies an overall strategy for the implementation of 
PIV authentication mechanisms with agency facility PACS.PIV authentication 
mechanisms with agency facility PACS._


####4. Prepare a Migration Plan
TODO: Here is where we talk about _Section 7: Migration strategy_.
* Selecting authentication mechanisms
* Identify technology gaps
* Select the appropriate solution
* Select a target PIV Implementation Maturity Model

####5. Get your FSC On-board
After providing the achievable levels of protection and the residual risks to 
the stakeholders on the FSC, you may or may not implement the countermeasures 
you found in _Section 5_.  The decision will be based upon the FSC 
stakeholders' willingness to accept the risks you identified and available 
budget.  The remaining risks after an agreed-upon set of countermeasures is 
decided, will be documented.
