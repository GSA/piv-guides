To submit comments and open an Issue:

1. **Establish a GitHub account.**  
  To submit a comment or open an Issue, you will need to create a GitHub account.  
  Create an account by browsing to this site: https://github.com/join  
  GitHub allows you to remain pseudonymous; you can select the options that suit you on the _Profile_ and _Emails_ pages of your _Personal Settings_ in your GitHub account.  
  We also highly encourage you to turn on **two-factor authentication** in the _Security_ page, also part of _Personal Settings_.

2. **Review open and closed issues to determine if a similar issue has already been created.**

2. Click on the _New Issue_ button in the upper right of the screen.
