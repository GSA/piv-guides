If you wish to Edit a page, or submit changes via a pull request you must:

1. **Establish a GitHub account.** In order to submit a comment through the GitHub “Issues” feature, you will need to create a GitHub account.  
You can create an account by browsing to this site: https://github.com/join  
GitHub allows you to remain pseudonymous, just make sure you select the options that suit you on the “Profile” and “Emails” pages of your “Personal Settings”.  
We also highly encourage you to turn on **two-factor authentication** in the “Security” page, also part of “Personal Settings”.
