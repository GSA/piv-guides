If you wish to Add a Page, or submit changes via a pull request you must:

1. **Establish a GitHub account.** In order to submit a comment through the GitHub “Issues” feature, you will need to create a GitHub account.  
You can create an account by browsing to this site: https://github.com/join  
GitHub allows you to remain pseudonymous, just make sure you select the options that suit you on the “Profile” and “Emails” pages of your “Personal Settings”.  
We also highly encourage you to turn on **two-factor authentication** in the “Security” page, also part of “Personal Settings”.

### Adding Content

*  To see an example of a topic, visit the Template sample [here](/pages/template.md).
*  To find this template directly, you can browse the pages folder in the repository and select the 'template.md' file.
*  Click the 'Raw' button towards the top right of the page to view the file as raw code. Within this file are helpful comments and instructions on where different parts of your content will be entered. Please note that you will not need to know how to code to contribute, as the only code within the file is simply to help format the final page.
*  Copy all of the samples from the template.
*  Navigate back to the pages folder and select the 'New file' button towards the top right of the page.
*  Enter a name for your file in the text box that says 'Name your file...', which will also act as the permanent link for your page.
*  Paste the samples and follow the instructions within the sample to populate the template with your content.

#### How to Submit Your Draft Guide
*  When your file is ready to be added to the repository, enter a title and quick description of your new page in the 'Commit new file' box at the bottom of the 'New file' page.
*  Within this box are two radio button options. Be sure to select the 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request' radio button, so that your content can go through the proper review process before going live on the Playbook site.
*  Click the 'Propose new file' button. This will route you to the 'Open a pull request' page.
*  Within the information box on the pull request page, create a title that reflects the nature of the content added, as well as a reference to the issue number that was opened stating the need for this topic, such as 'Issue #39 - Created a new page for how to enable PIV for logical access', entering any other relevant notes within the comment field.
*  Click the 'Create pull request' button. This will send a notification to the site administrators that a new page has been added, which they can then review.
*  Be sure to follow the progress of the issue that you opened stating what content you intended to add! This will allow you to see if others have comments or contributing information for the process, or if the site admin has responded with an updated status on your new page.

If you have a question during the contribution process, do not hesitate to open an issue requesting clarification.  You can also email us at icam at gsa dot gov.
