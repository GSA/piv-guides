Thank you for considering contributing to our development of open and transparent PIV Guides.  Everyone has tricks and tips and we want to share these with our colleagues! 

To contribute to this site, you can:

- [Open an Issue](#open-an-issue)
- [Edit an existing page](#edit-an-existing-page)
- [Add a new page](#add-a-new-page)
- [Notes on using this repository](#notes-on-using-this-repository)

Using GitHub as a first time user can be overwhelming.  An introduction video is available from DigitalGov on YouTube: [Introduction to GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNa9GOtM6NE&t=1737s){:target="blank"}.  


## Open an Issue

Issues are the primary way of sharing information and discussing this site with the broader community. For example, Issues can be used for:

* _Suggestions:_ You would like to suggest an edit or addition to any existing pages or information on this site
* _Corrections:_ You have identified a problem with existing information on the site and would like to discuss a correction

Issues may be submitted by clicking **Submit Issues Here** in the bottom of the left side navigation. 

For a quick guide on opening Issues, read [how to open issues.]({{site.baseurl}}/openissue/){:target="_blank"}

## Edit an existing page

Direct changes and line edits to the content may be submitted by clicking **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of each page.  You do not need to install any software to submit content. You can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit the changes for discussion. 

For a quick guide on editing a page, read [how to edit a page.]({{site.baseurl}}/editpage/){:target="_blank"}

## Add a new page
We welcome new pages and appreciate your contributions!  

First, propose a topic by [opening an Issue]({{site.baseurl}}/contribute/#open-an-issue){:target="blank"}.  If you don't have a topic, a good place to start is by reviewing the existing **Issues** lists. 

* [PIV Guides Issues](https://github.com/GSA/piv-guides/issues){:target="blank"} 
* [Federal PKI Guides Issues](https://github.com/GSA/fpki-guides/issues){:target="blank"} 
* [FICAM Architecture Issues](https://github.com/GSA/ficam-arch/issues){:target="blank"} 

Choose one of the Issues and start a conversation on the Issue.  You help clarify the problem and identify the solution by discussing the Issue first, and you can propose a format for the new page.  When you are ready, add a comment to the Issue that you would like to write up the solution!  We will create a new **branch** for you if needed.  

For a quick guide on adding a page, read [how to add a page.]({{site.baseurl}}/addpage/){:target="_blank"}

We have a [sample template with markdown samples]({{ site.repo_url }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/pages/template.md){:target="blank"}.

## Notes on using this repository

In the GitHub repository [here]({{site.repo_url}}){:target="_blank"} under the 'Code' tab:

![Code tabl]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/code_tab.png)

There are folders containing the content and diagrams. 

*  _pages_: includes the pages for Introduction, Identifiers, Getting Started, and Certificate Trust
* _networkconfig_: includes the pages for the configurations for network authentication
* _img_: includes all diagrams and images and are available for download and reuse anywhere

We encourage you to read our [LICENSE]({{ site.repo_url }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/LICENSE.md){:target="_blank"} and our [README]({{ site.repo_url }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/README.md){:target="_blank"}, which exist within this repository.  

###  General Practices

This content is Vendor neutral. Marketing materials for Commercial Products should not be submitted. If you would like to contribute a page or content which includes Commercial Products and specific references for development and engineering, please review the Commercial Product trademark or copyright guides from the Product Vendor and reference those guides in your Pull Request.  

### Plain Language

Contributors should consider the audience when submitting content. Plain language benefits a broad audience. Review your proposed content for use of acronyms and specialized jargon before submitting.

  * All pages should be brief.
  * Use titles to help the user identify jumping off points for information.
  * Paragraphs should be short. 
  * All text should be written in plain language and in a user-friendly active voice as much as possible. 
  * Use numbered steps, bullet lists, and graphics.

The following sources can provide additional help with plain language, writing, and style:

  * [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/){:target="_blank"}
  * [Federal Plain Language Guidelines](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/){:target="_blank"}
