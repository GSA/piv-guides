## General Practices
This content is Vendor neutral.  Marketing materials for Commercial Products should not be submitted.  If you would like to contribute a page or content which includes Commercial Products and a specific references for development and engineering, please review the Commercial Product trademark or copyright guides from the Product Vendor and reference those guides in your Pull Request.

Contributors should consider the audience when submitting content.  Plain language benefits a broad audience.  Review your proposed content for use of acronyms and specialized jargon before submitting.
