PIV User Guides are to help users successfully understand and leverage their PIV credential to access federal systems and facilities. These guides are intended to be non-technical and include instructions that an agency can leverage in customer service procedures or as online resources by linking directly.  

We are gathering user guides and invite you to contribute.

Examples of user guide topics:

* How do I enable Firefox to allow the use of PIV?
* How do I enable Chrome to allow the use of PIV?
* How do I send my certificates to a user in another agency to allow encrypting documents or emails to me?
* Common errors and easy self fix options

You can [contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/) to this effort or open an [Issue]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) to discuss a need you may have for a guide.
