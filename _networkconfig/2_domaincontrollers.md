# How do I generate and install Certification Authority (CA) certificates for Domain Controllers?

These procedures are intended for network and system administrators, or other IT professionals, who are responsible for the day-to-day network operations of Federal Government agencies. As part of their roles, these professionals will be authorized by their agencies to manage various aspects of their networks, including generating and installing CA certificates for their Domain Controllers. Domain Controller certificates are required in order for the agencies' authorized users to use PIV card credentials for network authentication. 

{% include alert-info.html heading = "Devices authenticate too!" content="When your users are using certificates to authenticate to the network, the Domain Controllers are also authenticating as devices that use certificates. This system works together to create secure connections. To learn more, click on the links below or search for online resources that discuss Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT) protocols." %}

## Domain controller certificate profiles

Domain Controller certificates must be issued with a set of specific extensions and values.  The certificate profile for each Domain Controller must meet the following requirements:

- The certificate **Key Usage** extension must contain:

            Digital Signature, Key Encipherment

- The certificate **Enhanced Key Usage** extension must contain:

            Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
            Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)

- The certificate **Subject Alternative Name** extension must contain the Domain Name System (DNS) qualifier and fully qualified Domain controller name.  For example:

            DNS Name=controller1.intranet.agency.gov

- The certificate **Subject Alternative Name** must also contain the Domain Controller's Global Unique Identifier (GUID) (i.e., for the "Domain Controller object"). 

  * To determine the Domain Controller's GUID, start **Ldp.exe** and locate the **domain-naming context**. 
  * Double-click on the **name of the Domain Controller** whose GUID you want to view.
  
    > The list of attributes for the Domain Controller object contains **"Object GUID" followed by a long number**. The number is the object GUID. For example:

            Other Name: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.1 = ac 4b 29 06 bb d6 5d 4f e3 9c 4c ab c3 6a 55 d9

    > The Domain Controller's certificate must be installed in the domain controller's local computer's **_personal certificate store_**, as described below in the _Generate and install Domain Controller certificate_ procedures.

## Issue Domain Controller certificates

Each U.S. Federal Government's Civilian agency has information-security policies that guide its decision-making about whether its Domain Controller's <!-- More than one DC? More than one certificate possible? -->certificate should be issued by the agency's local enterprise Certificate Authority (CA) or whether a Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI)-managed and certified CA should issue it. Providing a common guide and recommendation is challenging, as each agency should follow its own policies; however, we do not recommend that agencies set up a local enterprise CA just to issue Domain Controller certificates. The best option is to collaborate with your agency's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) (or the Information Security Office), who can give you definitive direction and has oversight for managing CAs and ensuring that security protections are in place.

## Generate and install Domain Controller certificate

_**Use Case:** We would like to use a local enterprise Microsoft CA to issue a Domain Controller certificate to the Domain Controller server. The server must have a certificate installed with the appropriate fields/values as a prerequisite to enabling authorized users with PIV credentials (i.e., PIV cards) to log into domain-connected devices._

  > **Note:** These procedures are accurate for using Microsoft 2012 Server, Standard Edition, for CA and Domain Controller servers (as of March 2017).

### Prerequisite

  * The server that hosts the CA must be on the domain

### Install CA role

  1. Log into the **CA server** as a member of the **Enterprise Administrators** group.
  2. Open the **Server Manager**.
  3. Click on **Manage**, and then click on **Add Roles and Features**.
  4. Proceed through the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** options. Choose the following:
     1. Server Roles: **_Active Directory Certificate Services_**
     2. AD CS Roles Services: **_Certification Authority_** 
  5. On the **Results** page, click on **Configure Active Directory Certificate Services on the destination server**.
  6. Proceed through the **AD CS Configuration** options. Choose the following, as necessary:
     1. Role Service: **_Certification Authority_** 
     2. Setup Type: **_Enterprise CA_** 
     3. CA Type: **_Root CA_**
     4. Private Key: **_Create a new private key_** 
     5. Cryptography: **_RSA#Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider, 2048 bit, SHA-256 6e_**
     6. CA Name: Use the recommended naming convention:
        **dc=[_AD suffix_], dc=[_AD domain_], cn=[_certification authority name_]** 
        (e.g., dc=_gov_, dc=_[AgencyName]_, cn=_[AgencyName]_ _NPE_ _CA1_) 
     7. Validity Period: **_6 years_** 
     8. Certificate Database: **_&lt;your preference&gt;_** 

## Configure CA template for Domain Controller

  > **Note:** Certificate templates are available on enterprise CAs.

  1. Log into the CA server as a member of the **Enterprise Administrators** group.
  2. Open the certificate template's **MMC snap-in** (i.e., **certtmpl.msc**). 
  3. Right-click on the **Domain Controller Authentication** template, and then click on **Duplicate Template**.
  4. Under the **Compatibility** tab, modify the **Compatibility Settings** for both the _CA_ and _certificate recipients_ to the highest version compatibility as possible (e.g., **Windows Server 2012 R2** or **Windows 7 2008 R2**).
  5. Under the **General** tab, we recommend the following settings:
     1. Template Name:  rename to:  **_&lt;Your organization&gt; - Domain Controller Authentication_**.
     2. Validity Period:  **_3 years_**.
     3. Renewal Period:  **_6 weeks_**.
  6. Under the **Cryptography** tab, set the following values:
     1. Minimum Key Size:  **_2048_**.
     2. Request Hash:  **_SHA256_** (if possible).
  7. Open the **CA console** (i.e., **certsrv.msc**).
  8. In the **console tree**, click on the **_[CA's name]_**.
  9. In the **details** pane, double-click on **Certificate Templates**.
 10. In the **console tree**, right-click on **Certificate Templates** and click on **New**. Then, click on **Certificate Template To Issue**.
 11. Select and enable the **_certificate template_** that was created, and then click on **OK**

## Auto-enroll Domain Controller certificate using Group Policy Object (GPO)**

  1. Log into the **Domain Controller server** as a member of the **Enterprise Administrators** group.
  2. Open the **GPMC** (i.e. **gpmc.msc** ).
  3. Within the appropriate **GPO**, navigate to **_Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Public Key Policies\**_**
  4. Configure **Certificate Services Client â€“ Auto-Enrollment** with the following options:
     1. Configuration Model: **_Enabled_**.
     2. For Renew Expired Certificates, Update Pending Certificates, Remove Revoked Certificates: **_Check_all checkboxes_**.
     3. Update Certificates That Use Certificate Templates: **_Check the checkbox_**.
  5. At the command line, you can now force the group policy to update via the command: **_gpupdate /force_** or wait for the group policy to update on its own.
  6. If successful, you will see a new Domain Controller certificate in the **_Certificate (Local Computer) -&gt; Personal -&gt; Certificates folder_** (e.g., **_open MMC.exe -&gt; File -&gt; Add/Remove Snap-in -&gt;Certificates -&gt;Computer account -&gt;Local computer)_**.
  
  > At the **Certificate Template** tab, you should see a certificate generated with the custom certificate template.
