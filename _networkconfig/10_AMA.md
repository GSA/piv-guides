You may need to make privilege decisions in applications for your agency users when they log in with their PIV/CAC or client certificate credential versus another lower assurance authentication method. To help you do this, you can use a Windows Active Directory (AD) feature called _Authentication Mechanism Assurance (AMA)_. AMA allows you to add a global group membership to a user’s Kerberos token, based on the PIV/CAC's certificate policy.

AMA is available in Windows Server® 2008 R2 and later versions. Go to:&nbsp;&nbsp;[AMA Step-by-Step Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378897(v=WS.10).aspx){:target=_"blank"} to understand the implementation of AMA.

{% include info-warning.html content="Do not use AMA to provide privileged user access to servers without another access control method in combination with AMA." %}

### PowerShell Script To Import Common Federal/DoD Certificate Policies
You can use this [CertificateIssuanceOIDs.ps1](https://github.com/GSA/ficam-scripts-public/tree/master/_ama){:target="_blank"} PowerShell script to import a list of Federal Common/DoD Certificate issuance policies. This simplifies Microsoft TechNet's steps for setting up the policies. The script has a list of policies to import grouped under different categories. You should only import the policies that are applicable to your agency. 

The script creates active directory security groups with the same name as the certificate issuance policies and links the policies to the groups. It also creates the active directory groups container (ou=Groups) if it does not exist under ou=Administrators.

You may have to change the [powershell script execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-5.1&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-Microsoft.PowerShell.Core){:target="_blank"} to execute this script or sign the script to execute it after downloading.

An sample output of the script for one policy is shown below.

     PS C:\> C:\AMA\Script\CertificateIssuanceOIDs.ps1
     Created OU=Administrators,DC=agency,DC=gov
     Created OU=Groups,OU=Administrators,DC=agency,DC=gov
     Created CN=id-fpki-common-authentication,OU=Groups,OU=Administrators,DC=agency,DC=gov
     2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.13 -- Unknown ObjectId

     Localized name added to DS store.
     0: 1033,id-fpki-common-authentication
     CertUtil: -oid command completed successfully.
     Created CN=13.255922318A2AF32EC47D5B70735D4DB3,CN=OID,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=agency,DC=gov
     AD AMA set for 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.13  id-fpki-common-authentication

When you login to your workstation with a PIV/CAC credentials, you will see that you have been assigned the group based on the certificate policy in your PIV/CAC. To find the group membership, you can issue the command '_whoami /groups_'. An example is shown below for the group set above.

     C:\whoami /groups
     .....
     agency\id-fpki-common-authentication   Group  S-1-5-21-179144328 1-1764752353-2202401552-1113 
          Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
     .....

### Windows Server® 2008 R2 Considerations
* You should raise the Domain Functional Level to Windows Server 2008 R2 if not already set.

* A Windows Server® 2008 R2-based Domain Hotfix corrects the known KDC error, "Access tokens are not updated correctly when you enable authentication mechanism assurance in a Windows Server 2008 R2-based domain." [Microsoft Hotfix](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2771254){:target="_blank"}. No patch is requried for Windows Server® 2012 and later versions.

### Other Considerations

* Use the Windows Registry Editor to set the _AMA Priority_ above _Most Recently Issued Superior Certificate Heuristic_:

          [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\kdc]
          "ChainWithIssuancePolicyOIDs"=dword:00000001
