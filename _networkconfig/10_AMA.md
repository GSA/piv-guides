### Authentication Mechanism Assurance

For the purpose of protecting resources based on login method, authentication mechanism assurance from Active Directory (AD) 
domain service adds an additional group membership to the user's security identifiers attribute (SIDs) 
when a user logs on using a certificate-based login method, such as a smart-card login. For example, you can restrict access 
to sensitive resources to users whom log on by using their smart cards, which requires a physical reader that you place 
in a physically secured location.
